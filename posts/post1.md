In order to develop the personality and character of the student youth through voluntary community service, National Service Scheme(NSS) was established in India in the year 1969.
Now, NSS students from our St.Jude's college Thoothoor are engaged in cleaning of one of the  environmentaly conscious coastal villages, Chinnathurai  and planting 1000 trees in association with Clean and Green Chinnathurai as scheduled activities of the camp. 
Heartfelt CONGRATULATIONS....
and best wishes for the Success of the Camp....
