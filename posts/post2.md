MESSENGERS of Marine  Environment
×××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××
A day before Yesterday, it seemed to be  an unbelievable event of that the school students in school uniform were sportively collecting 56.8kg of plastic waste and filling the bags one by one at the beach  in association with Negili illa Neithalpadai(நெகிழி இல்லா நெய்தல் படை) and  CLEAN and GREEN Chinnathurai as a part of the ongoing celebration of 100th week of series beach cleaning  and environmental awareness festival. During this ever memorable programme, around 150 students and Teachers from Little Flower Matric and Central school Pushpagiri, Choozhal participated to have as a first-hand experience of protecting the marine environment and witnessed the causes as well as impacts of coastal erosion with their own eyes.
Here i remember that, in my college days of post graduation, we students went for visiting one of the most unique ecosystems  and a national park in Kerala, "Silent Valley" in order to study the environmental degradation due to human activities. Likethat, now this visit of a team of nature loving school students  at the sea shore is very much appreciable and academically valuable. Because, this wonderful learning experience from the field in a sunny day could be more effective rather than a four walled-class room learning by using a prescribed textbook with colorful pictures. Also  in future similar to  story tellers, these young messengers of Marine Environment can spread the news to others  about the necessity of saving the sand and sea as a asset of fishermen community.
Let us not forget that, "today we all can enjoy fish foods on a dining table because our hard working fishermen did fishing in a  deep sea for us yesterday"
